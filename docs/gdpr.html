      <b>Summary</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Cypher System SRD Lookup does not automatically collect identifying information about users.
      The best way to remove your data is to simply delete the app from your device.
      If have concerns, please contact the developer at privacy@isaaclyman.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Details</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where you would normally find information about how to require
      an app to "forget" about you (i.e. delete all information it has retained
      in connection to your identity). However, Cypher System SRD Lookup does not collect any data.
    </p>
    <p>
      No identifiers are collected and users do not log in. This means 
      all users are anonymous and privacy concerns are kept to a minimum.
    </p>

      <b>The developer cannot issue refunds for the app or any in-app purchase.</b> Please
      contact the app store for your mobile operating system to discuss refunds.
